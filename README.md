<h1>Collatz-Conjecture</h1>
<p>Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that  was introduced by Lothar Collatz in 1937. It is also known as the 3n + 1 problem</p>
<h2>The Conjecture</h2>
<p>The sequences defined as follows: 
<ol>
<li>Start with any positive integer n</li>
<li>If the previous term is even, then divide it by 2</li>
<li>If the previous term is odd, then multiply it with 3 and add 1</li>
</ol
</p>
<p>The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.</p>
